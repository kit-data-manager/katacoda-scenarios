In this tutorial we've learned the basics of using MetaStore. However, this was just
a very small part of the story. For more details, please refer to the source code repository
at [GitHub](https://github.com/kit-data-manager/metastore2) and to the developer documentation
accessible at each running MetaStore instance at http://hostname:port/static/docs/documentation.html.
